### 🚀 About Me

Hey there — I’m Nduka, a backend-focused problem solver with a thing for clean architecture, smart systems, and real-world impact.  
Currently diving deep into backend engineering at **ALX**, with roots in **Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering** from **Ahmadu Bello University**.

I'm big on **building scalable backend systems**, **connecting software with hardware**, and making technology work *for* people — not the other way around.

---

### 🔥 What Drives Me

- ⚙️ **Backend Engineering** – I enjoy building APIs, database systems, and logic that power great experiences.
- 🌍 **Solving Real Problems** – I get a kick out of creating software that actually helps people.
- 🔌 **Embedded Systems & IoT** – My electronics background fuels my curiosity around smart, connected devices.

---

### 🛠️ Projects I'm Crafting

Here’s what I’m currently working on (and proud of):

- 🏡 **Airbnb Clone** – Think listings, bookings, reviews, and a backend that handles it all.
- 🎮 **Maze Game** – A C + SDL2 game built from scratch, one wall and algorithm at a time.
- 🎧 **Mood-Based Playlist Generator** – Music that understands your vibe using smart recommendations.
